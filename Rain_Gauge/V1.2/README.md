# magDrone/Hydrologic Parameters/V0 Development/V 0.6/Raingauge
This is the drop counter verson of the raingauge for all previous versions see v0.5 folder (piezoelectric, resistivity, capacitance, and pressure)

##  How it works
- See powerpoint
- Raindrops are funneled together
- Individual drops are reformed using a Nozzle
- Individual drops fall from nozzle and are detected by electroids
- Drops continue into collection area and drain from the system

## As of 5/6/2021
- Drop formation size of 0.007675 in^3/drop
- Intake area of 4.43014 in^2
- Resolution of 0.001732 inches of water (per drop)

### What we have
- CAD files
  - Funnel
  - Nozzle/electrodes/drainage system
- Lab testing
- Data results

###  Next Steps
- integrate with PCB package
- Outdoor testing
- Get more data
- Find optimum nozzle parameters
- Determine drop parameters for nozzle
- CFD of drop formation
